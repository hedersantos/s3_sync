# s3_sync

## About `s3_sync`  

Synchronize entire folders from local machine to a given AWS S3 Bucket.  

Feel free to contribute and suggest improvements to it.  

### Prerequisites  

This function leverages AWS CLI's functionality to simplify synchronizing folders  
to S3 Bucket. Install AWS CLI to be able to use this function.  

### Usage Examples

#### Uploading `~/Pictures/pets` folder to the Cloud: sync upwards  

```bash
# go into the folder you want to sync
cd ~/Pictures/pets

# invoke helper function
$ s3_sync --up

# function appends path to current folder* to S3 bucket env var
EDIT or press ENTER to confirm S3 location: s3://bucket-name/Pictures/pets

# user confirms whether AWS CLI command should be executed
EXECUTE "aws s3 sync /home/john/Pictures/pets s3://bucket-name/Pictures/pets"? (y/n) 

# upload process begins: AWS CLI output follows
STARTED sync operation...
```

Imagine now you add or update files hosted in this S3 bucket.

#### Fetching new and changed files from the Cloud: sync downwards  

```bash
# go into the folder you want to sync
cd ~/Pictures/pets

# invoke helper function
$ s3_sync --down

# confirm S3 "path" from which to fetch data
EDIT or press ENTER to confirm S3 location: s3://bucket-name/Pictures/pets

# confirm AWS CLI command to be issued
EXECUTE "aws s3 sync s3://bucket-name/Pictures/pets /home/john/Pictures/pets"? (y/n) y

# download process begins: AWS CLI output follows
STARTED sync operation...
```

### Function setup  

`s3_sync` expects an environment variable called `S3_SYNC_BUCKET_NAME` pointing  
to the S3 Bucket where your data will be stored.  
To add this on Ubuntu, edit the `s3_sync_bucket_name.sh` script and copy it to  
`/etc/profile.d` directory.  

Then add the function below to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:  

> REMEMBER to change `path_to_repo` with the path where you cloned this repo.

> \# s3_sync  
function s3_sync () {  
&emsp; # check whether script exists  
&emsp; if [ -e $HOME/path_to_repo/s3_sync/s3_sync.sh ]  
&emsp; # execute script and pass all arguments to it  
&emsp; then bash $HOME/path_to_repo/s3_sync/s3_sync.sh $@  
&emsp; fi  
}
